Next Chapter is a book club application that makes it easy for people to join together for a common purpose. It is a social media service that enables users to form and participate in virtual “book club” groups, geared towards fostering and promoting community-building and discussion, education and self-improvement, and personal leisure. The website allows users to join any number of existing groups and create new groups. Members of a group can set the book currently being read and discussed by the group and post topic threads for discussion or analysis. Admins can update the group name, description, and password, and they can remove any blog posts or members as needed.
